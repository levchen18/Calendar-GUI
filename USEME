This is direction on how to use our GUI:

Our GUI will ask users for information regarding the events and users will input it based
on what is asked.

Entering information: Users will enter the information of the events within the text boxes.
They will enter event name, start DateTime, end DateTime, Location, and Description for that event.
- There is a check box for all day event, if user click on it the event will be set from 8am to 5pm

Users can also have the selection of selecting the status of the event to see if the event should be private or public.
The status is chosen as a drop down selection.

After an event is created, a message will be displayed regarding if the event was created successfully or not.
If not, an error will get displayed in red.

When events are created, users can view the events on that day by clicking on view schedule. This
allows the users to view the events on that day. The user can change the day they want to view in "Select Date to View".
By changing the date to view users can see dates on certain days. If no events are happening that day, it will say
no events on that day.

Users can create more then one calendar within this program by clicking on the plus symbol on the top right corner.
This will ask users for a new calendar name, time zone, and other information. After mulitple calendars are crated, the
user can use the drop down selection on the left of the + symbol to select the different calendars.

Users are also able to edit the calendar. The event information will be displayed on the white box on the bottom. Users
will click on the event they want to edit and manual change the information within the textbox. After changes are made, users will
click on the save button to save the changes. Users should be able to the same things in the other calendar as well.
